Inset layout blocks that extend horizontally beyond the content area.

In some themes, the width of the content area does not span the entire width of the viewport and has a fixed width limit. It is used to exceed the content width limit and perform effects such as changing the background color for the horizontally penetrating area.

Note: This module starts at the center of the screen and spans the width of the screen. It works well with layouts where the content area is exactly centered with respect to the screen. If there is a column on either the left or right and the content area is close, it may be displayed as if it is slightly misaligned.
