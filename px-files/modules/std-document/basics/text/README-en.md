Insert text.

You can choose your favorite text style from HTML format, Markdown format, and plain text.

## Type of writing

### HTML format

This is how to write HTML directly.
Those who have knowledge of HTML tags are suitable for inserting free expressions outside the fixed form.


### Plain text format

The text you wrote will be displayed in the browser as it is.
Line breaks are converted to `<br>` tags and HTML special characters are escaped.
If it contains a URL, it will be converted to a link.


### Markdown format

Markdown notation is a grammar that can express rich document structure with simple notation, and is used in many tools and services.

If you understand HTML, you can also embed HTML tags directly in a part of a document written in Markdown notation.
